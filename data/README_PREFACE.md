_Awesome bundlers (said no one ever...)_

Anyways, I'm pushing the list I've just made while searching for some bundler setup that I would not mislike.

Btw. If you're just starting to go into this rabbit hole - you may not need bundler! (cool read: [In 2020, go bundler-free](https://medium.com/@dmnsgn/in-2020-go-bundler-free-eb29c1f05fc9), tools: [#bundle-less]('#bundle-less'))

**What's here:**

- readme generator^^
- few sample projects
- shields.io badges abuse
